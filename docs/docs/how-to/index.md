# How-To Guides

Practical guides for accomplishing specific tasks with Clawless.

## Command Generation

### [Generate Commands](./generate-commands)

Use the Clawless CLI to quickly create new commands and nested command
structures without manually writing boilerplate.

## Command Attributes

### [Add Command Aliases](./add-command-aliases)

Create short aliases for frequently used commands to improve user experience.

### [Require Subcommands](./require-subcommands)

Prevent command execution without a subcommand, automatically showing help
instead.

## Project Organization

### [Organize Large CLI Applications](./organize-large-cli)

Structure your Clawless project as it grows, separating CLI interface from
business logic.

## About How-To Guides

These guides are task-oriented and assume you already understand Clawless
basics. If you're new to Clawless, start with the [Quick Start](../quick-start)
or [Concepts](../concepts) section first.

Each guide focuses on a specific task and shows you how to accomplish it
step-by-step.
