[output]
# When outputting inclusion graphs in diagnostics that include features, this
# option can be used to specify the depth at which feature edges will be added.
# This option is included since the graphs can be quite large and the addition
# of features from the crate(s) to all of the graph roots can be far too verbose.
# This option can be overridden via `--feature-depth` on the cmd line
feature-depth = 1
